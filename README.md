## Projects
### Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Machine Learning is a system used for disease prediction based on patient or user symptoms. The Naïve Bayes classifier is used for supervised prediction, and calculating disease probabilities. Accurate analysis of medical data aids early disease detection and patient care, using linear regression and decision trees for diseases like Diabetes, Malaria, Jaundice, Dengue, and Tuberculosis.

### Gym management System in Python
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Everything that takes place in the gym will be automated by the GYM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. It is intended to support and make life easier for everyone who trains at the gym, works there, or owns the facility. The database includes daily objectives, statistics on the accomplishments and development of gym members, contact information for each individual, personal information of all members, the training programs the facility provides, equipment, etc.
